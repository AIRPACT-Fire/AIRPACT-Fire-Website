Welcome to AIRPACT Visual Range research!

We have made this document to help guide you when starting out, and to
give you general information about the setup.

Github:

We have included a github extension in with JupyterHub! feel free to put your
research in the public domain, and collaborate with others working on the
visual range problem.

I would like to suggest tagging your work with #AIRPACT_VISUAL_RANGE so that
others working on this platform may find your work, and build on it!

Python Library:

We have created a library for easy data access. Supported on Python3, the
AirpactVR library provides easy access to data! Simply import 'AirpactVR' and
type help(AirpactVR) in your python interpreter for documentation.

An example of how to use this library to view pictures should be in your home
directory.

Data Location:

The datas location as of now (April 18th 2019) is
/home/admin/website/AirpactJupyter/pythonLib/defaultVisualRangeDataLocation
But this is subject to change. To get the most recent location, access it
through the module AirpactVR by typing AirpactVR.GetDefaultFolder()
